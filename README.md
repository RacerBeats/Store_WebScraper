# Store_WebScraper
 Python Data Science Portfolio Project 1: Online Store Web Scraper

This project aims to show my ability to use Python and some supporting libraries to 
create a rudimentary web-scraper.

Main Objective: Create a web-scraper to store and compare prices on a single item
                across different online stores.
