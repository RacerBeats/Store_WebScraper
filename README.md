# Store_WebScraper
 Python Data Science Portfolio Project 1: Online Store Web Scraper

This project aims to show my ability to use Python and some supporting libraries to 
create a rudimentary web-scraper.

Main Objective: Create a web-scraper to store and compare prices on a single item
                across different online stores.

Secondary Objective: Learn how to deal with dynamic websites.
This project will first start by scraping a dummy site first, then
move up to more complex websites as we go on.
